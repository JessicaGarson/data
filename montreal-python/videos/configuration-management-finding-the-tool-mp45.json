  "description": "Montreal, April 14, 2014 - by Joseph Hall from SaltStack\nIn ye olde days of web, a company might manage a handful of servers, each manually and frequently tuned and re-tuned to the company's needs. Those days are gone. Server farms now dominate, and it is no longer reasonable to manage individual servers by hand. Various configuration management tools have stepped in to help the modern engineer, but which to choose? It is not an easy question, and canned pitches from sales people are unlikely to take into account all of your variables. This talk will attempt to discuss The Big Four objectively, and from what angles they approach the task at hand.\n\nUseful links:\n* SaltStack: http://www.saltstack.com\n* Joseph: https://twitter.com/techhat\n* MP45: http://sflx.ca/mp45e\n* Montreal Python: http://montrealpython.org\n* Savoir-faire Linux: http://www.savoirfairelinux.com",
