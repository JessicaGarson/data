  "description": "Montreal, April 14, 2014 - Yannick Gingras gives an overview of the problems that Facebook faces deploying cache services that answer over a billion queries per second while maintaining sub-millisecond response time. He describes the strategies that he uses to mitigate them and since Python is a critical piece of the puzzle, he highlights some of the areas of this usage. I tells war stories and the sense of scale can feel crushing at times, but he does his best to keep it entertaining.\u00b8\n\nUseful links:\n* Memecache: https://www.facebook.com/MemcacheAtFacebook\n* Yannick: https://twitter.com/ygingras\n* MP45: http://sflx.ca/mp45e\n* Montreal Python: http://montrealpython.org\n* Savoir-faire Linux: http://www.savoirfairelinux.com",
