  "description": "Montreal, Feb. 9th, 2015 - Marcin Swiatek has been using scipy.stats as his main library for all things statistics. And it was good and understandable. Recently, however, he needed to dive into some more advanced data exploration. Something people normally would use R for. Enter statsmodels...\nIn this presentation Marcin gives the neophyte's account of the strengths and uses of this library, working with an example data set to try and find something interesting in it.\n\nUseful links:\n* Marcin: http://sflx.ca/mswiatek\n* statsmodel: http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/\n* MP51: http://sflx.ca/mp51e\n* Montreal Python: http://montrealpython.org\n* Savoir-faire Linux: http://www.savoirfairelinux.com",
