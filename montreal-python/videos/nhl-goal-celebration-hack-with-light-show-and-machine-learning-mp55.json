  "description": "Montreal, Nov. 23, 2015 - In this talk Fran\u00e7ois Maillet explains how he trained a machine learning model in detecting in real-time that a goal was just scored by the Montreal Canadiens hockey team based on the live audio feed of a game, and triggering a light show using Philips hues in his living room. The system was built using various Python modules, more specifically scikit-learn, pyaudio, librosa, phue and bottle.\n\nRecorded and edited live by @ChristianAubry at Montr\u00e9al Python 55 (MP55: Wagnerian Xenosaurus) with a little big help from Savoir-faire Linux (http://sflx.ca/jobs).\n\n* About Fran\u00e7ois : https://twitter.com/mailletf\n* About the hack : http://sflx.ca/EpicCelebration\n* About MP55: http://sflx.ca/MP55e",
